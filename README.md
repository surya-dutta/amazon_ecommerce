# Amazon-E-commerce-Capstone-Project

Performed Sentiment analysis of 4000 Amazon customer reviews. Found main topics of the reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocator (LDA), and reviewed text to build a product recommender system using collaborative filtering. Generated word embeddings from Word2Vec and built an LSTM model to predict the sentiments of reviews.
